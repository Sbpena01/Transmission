# Transmission

This is my submission for the final RBE 550 Homework Assignment: Transmission. To run the full script, just run the main.py file.

If you just want to see the models and collision boxes, feel free to comment out lines 24 and 25 in main.py. This will prevent the RRT algorithm
from running and will just display the models of the transmission and the main shaft. To visualize the bounding boxes, make sure
'show_bounding_boxes' is set to true in line 22 of main.py. This should be on by default, but setting this to False will remove them.

Thank you!
